Steps or algorithm to solve the problem

    Step 1: Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in the guess_number variable.
    Important: Whenever the code runs, it will give you a random number.

    Step 2: Create an infinite while loop by setting the condition to True.
    The loop will continue until the condition becomes False or a break statement is encountered.

    Step 3: Take the player's guess as input, convert it into an integer,
    and store it in the user_guess_number variable.

    Step 4: Check if the guess_number is equal to user_guess_number.
    If the guess is correct, print Congratulations! You guessed the number!

    Step 5: If user_guess_number is less than guess_number, print Your guess is too low!

    Step 6: If user_guess_number is greater than guess_number, print Your guess is too high!
